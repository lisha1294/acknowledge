Category: The String Class
Question:  What will happen when you compile and run the following code:
	String search = "boo:and:foo";
	char c = search.charAt(search.length());
	System.out.println(c);
A. The code will compile and when run print "o".
B. The code will compile and when run have no output.
C. The code will not compile.
D. The code will compile but not run.
Answer:
D.  The code will compile and throw a runtime error:
java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 11
For answer A to print "o", you would have to use the following code:
char c = search.charAt(search.length()-1);
B is wrong as there would be no way to get no output from a the charAt method of a string with no spaces.
C is wrong as the code will compile fine.

Question:
What will be the output of this code snippet?
		String c2 = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
		char c3 = c2.charAt('!');
		System.out.println(c3);
A. The code will compile and when run print "H".
B. The code will compile and when run have no output.
C. The code will not compile.
D. The code will compile but not run.

Answer:
The correct answer is A.  The character '!' will be promoted to an integer with the value 33, so the it would be equivalent to the following:
char c3 = c2.charAt(33);
This will return the ASCII character for 33 which is "H".

Category: instanceof equality
Question:
What will the output of the following code be?
Object o1 = new Object();
Object o2 = new Object();
System.out.println("o1 is an Object? "+(o1 instanceof o2));
A. o1 is an Object? true
B. o1 is an Object? false
C. compile time error
D. runtime error

Answer:
This will cause a compile time error: cannot find symbol: o2.  The instanceof operator can not take instantiated objects as the right hand side operand, only classes.  
For example:
(o1 instanceof o2) Wrong.
(o1 instanceof Object) right!
- it will return true even if the right hand side is a super class.  ie:
class Animal {} class Cat extends Animal {}
Cat c = new Cat();
(c instanceof Animal) == true
