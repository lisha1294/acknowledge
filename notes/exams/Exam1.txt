Question 1:
What will the output of the following code be?
Object o1 = new Object();
Object o2 = new Object();
System.out.println("o1 is an Object? "+(o1 instanceof o2));
A. o1 is an Object? true
B. o1 is an Object? false
C. compile time error
D. runtime error

Answer:
This will cause a compile time error: cannot find symbol: o2.  The instanceof operator can not take instantiated objects as the right hand side operand, only classes.  
For example:
(o1 instanceof o2) Wrong.
(o1 instanceof Object) right!
- it will return true even if the right hand side is a super class.  ie:
class Animal {} class Cat extends Animal {}
Cat c = new Cat();
(c instanceof Animal) == true
