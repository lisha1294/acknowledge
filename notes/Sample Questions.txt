Sample Questions

Consider the following code snippet:
    arrayOfInts[j] > arrayOfInts[j+1]
Question: What operators does the code contain?
Answer: >, +

Consider the following code snippet:
int i = 10;
int n = i++%5;
    Question: What are the values of i and n after the code is executed?
    Answer: i is 11, and n is 0.
    Question: What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i))?
    Answer: i is 11, and n is 1.

Questions and Exercises: Inheritance
1.a and c incorrect.  How do you hide an inherited method?  It's considered a bad programming practice, but the table in Overriding and Hiding Methods section shows the effect of declaring a method with the same signature as a method in the superclass.
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/override.html

- What Integer method would you use to convert a string expressed in base 5 into the equivalent int? For example, how would you convert the string "230" into the integer value 65? Show the code you would use to accomplish this task.

- What Double method can you use to detect whether a floating-point number has the special value Not a Number (NaN)?

a len is 6. go from 5 to 0
-2. ?
3. Must extend an abstract class
4. An interface cant extend a class
An interface can extend multiple interfaces
5. Arrays are objects, so
int a[] = {1,2,3,4}
print(a instanceof Object) prints true.
-6. Indexing of array elemnts begins with zero, 43 = o53 (octal)
7. anonymous arrays.  assigned two one dimensional int arrays to the two dinmensiaonal array a.  So the code compiles and poroduces 2.
int a[][] = new int[3][];
a[1]=new int[]{1,2,3};
a[2]=new int[]{4,5};
print(a[1][1]);

class Base
{
	int i = 99;
	public void amethod()
	{
		System.out.println("Base.amethod");
	}
	Base()
	{
		amethod();
	}
}
public class Derived extends Base
{
	int i = -1;
	public static void main(String argv[])
	{
		Base b = new Derived();
		System.out.println(b.i);
		b.amethod();
	}
	public void amethod()
	{
		System.out.println("Derived.amethod()");
	}
}
Output: 
Derived.amethod()
99
Derived.amethod()
It creates an instance of the Derived class but assigns it to a reference of the Base class.  In this situation a reference to any of the fields such as i will refer to the value in the Base class, but a call to a method will refer to the method in the class type rather than its reference handle.  But note that if the amethod() was not present in the base class, then compilation error would be reported at compile time.  When the compiler sees the statement like b.amethod(), it checks if the method is present in the Base class or not.  Only at the run time it decides to call the method from the derived class.
13. 
String s = "Java";
s.concat(" SE 6");
s.replace('6','7');
print(s) // Java (the two calls are abandoned instantly)
14.
line 3, two more objects created, 'SE 6', and 'Java SE 6'
line 5 'java'

4. s.concat(" SE 6"); 2,3
5. s.toLowerCase();   4

1-3 OK
2. Any string other than 'true' of 'false' as a Boolean constructor will result in a value of false;
4. 
int a = 5;
print("Value is - "+((a < 5) ? 9.9 : 9));
The result of a ternary operator must be determined at the compile time, and here the type chosen using the rules of promotion for binary operands is double.  Since the result is a double the output value is
printed in a floating point.  The choice of which value to be printed is made on the basis of the result of the comparison "a < 5" which results in false, hence the variable "a" takes the second of the two possible values, which is 9, but because the result type is promoted to double the output value is actuallu written as 9.0 rather than the more obvious 9.
5. a,c,d,e (Ouch, no d! and b is ok too..)
public class Outer {
	public int a = 1;
	privte int b = 2;
	public void method(final int c)
	{
		int d = 3;
		class inner
		{
			private void iMethod(int e)
			{
				// which variables may be referenced here?
			}
		}
	}
}
a, b, c and e are correct. Since inner is not a static inner class, it has a reference to an enclosing object and all the variables of that object are accessible. Therefore A and B are correct even if b is private. Variables in the enclosing method are only accessible when they are marked as final, hence c is accessible but not d. E is obviously correct as it is a parameter to the method containing line 12 itself.  d is not final so not visible.
X6. - an overriding method can allow more, but not less, access than the overridden method. Order: public, protected, (no modifier), private

determine if cat can be found in the list?

a. list.contains("cat")
b. list.hasObject("cat") x
c. list.indexOf("cat")

a and c The contains method will return true if the object is found
and indexOf takes an object reference and returns the index
of the object if found, otherwise it returns a -1. The indexOf
method does not take an integer argument and the hasObject
method does not exist.

a. Static methods cannot be overloaded.
b. The return value is not considered when overloading a method.
c. Private methods cannot be overloaded.

a The return value is not considered when overloading a method.

Yes, we did get this right.  b is the correct answer.

Given the following code, which of the following statements are true?
public class SomeClass {
public SomeClass(int i, float f) { }
public SomeClass(float f, int i) { }
public SomeClass(float f) { }
public void SomeClass() { }}
a. error will occur cause void cannot be used with a constructor.
b. error will occur cause the first two constructors are not unique.
c. The class does not have a default constructor.
d. No syntax errors will be generated.
c and d The last line is a method that happens to have the same name
as the constructor. As there are constructors defined but no
default constructor, the class has no default constructor.

a. public  OK
b. private OK

public void someMethod(String[] parameters) {
SomeClass sc = new SomeClass();
sc.method1();
sc.method2();
sc.method3(); only protected methods are not visible.

a. sc.method1() will generate a syntax error.
b. sc.method2() will generate a syntax error.
c. sc.method3() will generate a syntax error.
d. sc.method4() will generate a syntax error.

What is true about local inner classes?
It can access only final variables.

A static method can only be hidden by another static method.  A static variable may be hidden by an instance variable.

The combination of 'abstract' and 'synchronized' modifiers are not allowed.

According to the JavaBean naming standards, if the boolean property is named 'x', the accessor method is of the form boolean isX() and the mutator method is of the form void setX(boolean newValue)

variable arguments allows a method to be called with ZERO or more arguments.

A variable from an interface is by default final so cannot be changed in a subclass.


Class members cannot use the this keywords as there is no this to refer to.

False: Member inner classes are the static class.

Finalize will always run before an object is garbage collected.

Questions: When using the writeObject method to store the state of an object, how can you protect sensitive data from being acessed in the stored object?
Answer: declare the sensitive fields as private transient.

Question: Which of the following keyword is used when a constructor calls an overload constructor in the same class.
Answer: this

Integer n1 = new Integer(0);
Byte n2 = new Byte((byte)0);
System.out.println(n1.equals(n2)); false!!!

- abstract classes cannot be instantiated

- super() must be the first statement in a subclass contructor.

quote(String s) returns a literal patter tring for the specified String.  This method produces a String that can be used to create a Pattern that would match the String s as if it were a literal pattern.  Meta characters or escape sequences in the input sequence will be given no special meaning.

- Number is the super class for many wrapper classes, but not Boolean and Character

- Nested (inner) classes can be declared abstract or final, private, public, or protected to restrict access to the class.

- The split() and matches() methods are present in both String and Pattern class.
