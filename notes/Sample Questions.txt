Sample Questions

Consider the following code snippet:
    arrayOfInts[j] > arrayOfInts[j+1]
Question: What operators does the code contain?
Answer: >, +

Consider the following code snippet:
int i = 10;
int n = i++%5;
    Question: What are the values of i and n after the code is executed?
    Answer: i is 11, and n is 0.
    Question: What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i))?
    Answer: i is 11, and n is 1.

Questions and Exercises: Inheritance
1.a and c incorrect.  How do you hide an inherited method?  It's considered a bad programming practice, but the table in Overriding and Hiding Methods section shows the effect of declaring a method with the same signature as a method in the superclass.

- What Integer method would you use to convert a string expressed in base 5 into the equivalent int? For example, how would you convert the string "230" into the integer value 65? Show the code you would use to accomplish this task.

- What Double method can you use to detect whether a floating-point number has the special value Not a Number (NaN)?

1. E
int []a = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
ini i = a.length -1;
while(i>=0)
{System.out.println(a[i]);i--}
Result 654321
a len is 6. go from 5 to 0
-2. ?
3. Must extend an abstract class
4. An interface cant extend a class
An interface can extend multiple interfaces
5. Arrays are objects, so
int a[] = {1,2,3,4}
print(a instanceof Object) prints true.
-6. Indexing of array elemtns begins with zero, 43 = o53 (octal)
7. anonymous arrays.  assigned two one dimensional int arrays to the two dinmensiaonal array a.  So the code compiles and poroduces 2.
int a[][] = new int[3][];
a[1]=new int[]{1,2,3};
a[2]=new int[]{4,5};
print(a[1][1]);
-8. b,d,e
-9. e
-10. e
11. wrong pass by reference nightmare
-12
13. 
String s = "Java";
s.concat(" SE 6");
s.replace('6','7');
print(s) // Java (the two calls are abandoned instantly)
14.
line 3, two more objects created, 'SE 6', and 'Java SE 6'
line 5 'java'
3. String s = "Java"; 1
4. s.concat(" SE 6"); 2,3
5. s.toLowerCase();   4
