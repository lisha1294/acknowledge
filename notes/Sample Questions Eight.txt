Question 22:
What will be the result of attempting to compile and run the following code?  
class SwitchTest{    
	public static void main(String args[]){       
		for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++){          
			boolean flag  = false;          
				switch (i){             
				flag  = true;          
				}          
			if ( flag )  System.out.println( i );       
		}    
	} 
}

Answer:
You cannot have unlabeled block of code inside a switch block. Any code block must succeed a case label (or default label). Since there is no case statement in this switch block, there is no way the line flag = true; can be reached! Therefore, it will not compile.
Correct response: Will not compile.  It will say 'case', 'default' or '}' expected at compile time.

Question 7:
What will be the result of attempting to compile and run the following program?

public class TestClass{
   public static void main(String args[]){
      try{
         RuntimeException re = null;
         throw re;
      }
      catch(Exception e){
         System.out.println(e);
      }
   }
}
1. The code will fail to compile, since RuntimeException cannot be caught by catching an Exception.
2. The program will fail to compile, since re is null.
3. The program will compile without error and will print java.lang.RuntimeException when run.
4. The program will compile without error and will print java.lang.NullPointerException when run.
5. The program will compile without error and will run and print null.

Answer:
1. RuntimeException can be caught by catch(Exception e) statement because RuntimeException is a subclass of Exception.
Explanation: 
4. A NullPointerException will be thrown if the expression given to the throw statement results in a null pointer. 
The try block generates NullPointerException which will be caught by the catch block.
Correct response: 4.

Question:
unsigned byte b = 0;

Answer:
Wont compile. A char can be used as an unsigned integer.
