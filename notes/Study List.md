Study List

- when you use an interface as a return type the object returned must implement the specified interface.

- byte: 8-bit min -128 max 127
- char: 16-bit min'\u0000' (or 0) max'\uffff' (65,535)
- short: 16-bit min -32,768 max 32,767
- int: 32-bit min -2,147,483,648(-2 tt 31)max 2,147,483,647(2 tt 31-1)
- float: 32-bit
- long: 64-bit min -2 tt 63 max 2 tt 63-1.
- double: 64-bit

byte 		8  If you Bite a
char/short  16 character it's shorter
int/float   32 inthe float but
long/double 64 longer in the double.

(Imagine biting an English letter so that the top half falls off and lands next to the bottom half. Now there is nothing floating above, but double and longer/wider down below.)

Instance override
Static hide.

- A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. 
- virtual method invocation: (polymorphism aspect), call method referred to in a variable, not the method that is defined by the variable's type
```
class A(){String toString(print("A"));}
class B(){String toString(print("B"));}
class C(){public static void main(String [] args)
{
	A a = new B();
	a.toString(); // prints B
}
```

perators make expressions.
Expressions make statements.
Statements make blocks.
Operators -> Expressions -> Statements -> Blocks

```
Set<String> s = new HashSet<String>();
```
Referring to collections only by their interface prevents you from 
using any nonstandard operations.

nondestructive idioms, first copy:
Set<Type> union/inter/diff = new HashSet<Type>(s1);
union.addAll(s2);
intersection.retainAll(s2);
difference.removeAll(s2);

- All constant values defined in an interface are implicitly public, static, and final and these can be omitted.

Things to do:  
overriding clone() example  
TreeSet stores its elements in a red-black tree

```
// Compile error cannot be referenced from a static context
Animal.testClassMethod()      - static Animal
Animal.testInstanceMethod()   - compile error
myAnimal.testClassMethod()    - static Animal Hidden
myAnimal.testInstanceMethod() - instance Cat
Cat.testClassMethod()         - static Cat
Cat.testInstanceMethod        - compile error
myCat.testClassMethod         - static Cat
myCat.testInstanceMethod      - instance Cat overriding

Animal.testClassMethod()      - static Animal
myAnimal.testClassMethod()    - static Animal Hidden
Cat.testClassMethod()         - static Cat
myCat.testClassMethod         - static Cat

Animal.testInstanceMethod()   - compile error
myAnimal.testInstanceMethod() - instance Cat
Cat.testInstanceMethod        - compile error
myCat.testInstanceMethod      - instance Cat overriding

            Class           Instance
Animal      Animal          x
myAnimal    Animal Hidden   Cat
Cat         Cat             x
myCat       Cat             Cat Overriding

Add to inheritance
- If the subclass is in the same package as its parent, it also inherits the package-private members of the parent. 
You can use the inherited members as is, replace them, hide them, or supplement them with new members:
- A nested class has access to all the private members of its enclosing classâ€”both fields and methods. Therefore, a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclass has indirect access to all of the private members of the superclass.
