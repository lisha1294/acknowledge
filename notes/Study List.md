Study List

- when you use an interface as a return type the object returned must implement the specified interface.

- byte: 8-bit min -128 max 127
- char: 16-bit min'\u0000' (or 0) max'\uffff' (65,535)
- short: 16-bit min -32,768 max 32,767
- int: 32-bit min -2,147,483,648(-2 tt 31)max 2,147,483,647(2 tt 31-1)
- float: 32-bit
- long: 64-bit min -2 tt 63 max 2 tt 63-1.
- double: 64-bit

byte 		8  If you Bite a
char/short  16 character it's shorter
int/float   32 inthe float but
long/double 64 longer in the double.

(Imagine biting an English letter so that the top half falls off and lands next to the bottom half. Now there is nothing floating above, but double and longer/wider down below.)

Instance override
Static hide.

- A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. 
- virtual method invocation: (polymorphism aspect), call method referred to in a variable, not the method that is defined by the variable's type
```
class A(){String toString(print("A"));}
class B(){String toString(print("B"));}
class C(){public static void main(String [] args)
{
	A a = new B();
	a.toString(); // prints B
}
```

perators make expressions.
Expressions make statements.
Statements make blocks.
Operators -> Expressions -> Statements -> Blocks

```
Set<String> s = new HashSet<String>();
```
Referring to collections only by their interface prevents you from 
using any nonstandard operations.

nondestructive idioms, first copy:
Set<Type> union/inter/diff = new HashSet<Type>(s1);
union.addAll(s2);
intersection.retainAll(s2);
difference.removeAll(s2);

###Branching Statements###
- An unlabeled break statement terminates the innermost switch, for, while, or do-while statement
- A labeled break terminates an outer statement.
- A continue statement skips the current iteration of a for, while , or do-while loop. 
- The unlabeled form skips to the end of the innermost loop's body and evaluates the boolean expression that controls the loop.
- A labeled continue statement skips the current iteration of an outer loop marked with the given label. 
- The return statement exits from the current method, and control flow returns to where the method was invoked. 
- The return statement has two forms: one that returns a value, and one that doesn't. 
- To return a value, put the value (or an expression that calculates the value) after the return keyword.
- When a method is declared void, use the form of return that doesn't return a value.


Add to inheritance
- If the subclass is in the same package as its parent, it also inherits the package-private members of the parent. 
You can use the inherited members as is, replace them, hide them, or supplement them with new members:
- A nested class has access to all the private members of its enclosing classâ€”both fields and methods. Therefore, a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclass has indirect access to all of the private members of the superclass.
