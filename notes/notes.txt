These are random notes as we get ready for the Programmer Level I Exam (associated with the "Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 7 Programmer"), as well as getting to know generics for the Level II Exam, along with learning Groovy and some Scala, and the beginnings of Java 8.

"an anonymous class seems a bit excessive and cumbersome."  (From 'Learning the Java Language' Trail)
So Java 8 contains closures as well.  The above is admiting that Java has been excessive and cumbersome for the past 20 years.  But maybe there is hope.  It would be nice if the docs admitted their inspiration.
They could say, "Thanks to efforts by the creators of Groovy, Scala and Clojur to simplify the Java language.  We have answered their calls after 10 years on JCP and introduced functions like lambda expressions (closures)."  They could even qualify this with "After all, they are riding on our coat-tails/bytcode platform".

Groovy: this.args.each{ arg -> println "hello, ${arg}"}
Java 8: p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE

Is programming finally being liberated from the von Neuman Style?
After reading some comments from the developers release page of Java 8, it seems at least one developer our of the 8 million isn't so happy about Lambda's:
"I uderstand the value of Lambdas but I'd prefer a slightly more verbose syntax if only it looked more 'Javaish' and easier to read... Perl as a culture favors tersness over readability.  This is evident in their syntax and total lack of comments in most public projects."
Well, like Democratic politics, that's what happens when you try to please everyone; no one likes it.

- a sentence, as part of a conversation, has words in it which are learning objects that can either pass or fail upon different aspects, such as speaking (pronunciation) or listening, or writing (mispelling) or reading.  Listening and reading could be more problematic, because we dont know if the person missted the point of the sentence because of a certain unknown word, or a combination of words/grammer.  The same with listening.

To do
-  The toString() method provides a canonical representation of a BigDecimal.
- As a corollary of computing the exact result, the rounding mode setting of a MathContext object with a precision setting of 0 is not used and thus irrelevant.
- corollary: 
1.Mathematics . a proposition that is incidentally proved in proving another proposition.
2.an immediate consequence or easily drawn conclusion.
3.a natural consequence or resul
- when is NaN false:
    double var = 1000;
    if (var == Double.NaN) 
If you can only use that method on a double?
- Can we get an example of a Initializer blocks copied into a constructor?
- how does BoxDemo use the ArrayList when it is not returned after being operated on.  Is ArrayList a live class that will act like a memeber variable without being declared as such?  Indeed it does change without being a member variable.
It's amazing how I have been using Java for over ten years but didn't understand some very fundamental things about it.  For one that it's a pass-by-value language.  The answer to my question posed a few months ago about what I called a live variable, is that the reference to the ArrayList is what is passed to the method, so that any changes to the list will persist becaucse the reference from the calling method is the same reference.  So then you might think that Java is actually a pass-by-reference languae.  And many people would argue about that, like they did here: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40480/is-java-pass-by-reference
It's a greate discussion.  Noticing the aversion for the word pointer.  Then someone pointing out (pun intended) that the main error we get is called a NullPointerException.  My take is that Java is a pass-by-address(or primitive) language, but Ganash pointed out that this is the definition of a reference, so maybe I still can't explain this clearly even after reading all the answers on that page.  Althought Ganash's answer didn't get much support... 
A primitive passed into a method will not persist any changes that happen to it in the method.  Also, a String that is immutable will not change, but a StringBuffer will, as pointed out by Kukudas.
What is amazing about that link above is this: asked 5 years ago, viewed
314888 times, active 5 days ago.
To think of all the times I returned objects from a method when the simple fact is I didn't need to.  Or when I created a vector of objects to return because only one object can be returned from a method when actually I didn't need to.  Even if the method is in a different class!  See the class ByValue.java in the java directory for proof of this.
Some good quotes from the discussion link above:

If a Java object "behaves" like it is being passed by reference, that is a property of mutability and has absolutely nothing to do with passing mechanisms.  I am not sure why this is so confusing, perhaps because so many Java "programmers" are not formally trained, and thus do not understand what is really going on in memory?  by Rusty Shackleford

Some might say the "value" of the address, and some say it's just a reference to the object. This is the genesis of the holy war between "reference" and "value" proponents... C++ programmers would call this a pointer, but some Java developers are racist against the word "pointer". Whatever. Just know that the address of the object goes in the stack.  by cutmancometh

Happiness

- manage happiness folders.
- put number of happy and sad images created in creation studio.
- display name in studio.

#settings file#
- selection mode: singleexclusive or double/non-exclusive

Features
- webiste for upload and download of happiesive you compassion points.  package folder into a zip utility for up/download
- when sadness has a reason.
- art therapy or measure/check youre happiness/mood/feelings
- plan your happiness.

What is Happiness?
- hap is the root of the word and means good fortune.

#When sadness has a reason#
- sadness/trauma can make you stronger.  appreciate youre life as it is.  people are the better for their sadness, for coming out the end/survivor.  stronger, wiser and more compassionate for coming thru the sadness.  A challenge that leads to growth.  Going thru turmoil with someone lets you know how compatible they are with you.
- happy about going somewhere
- people in hosptal are sad, but they have a reason to be sad.
- upward or downward comparrisons.  When you are the only person with something, you are happy.  but when everyone has it, then you don't feel happy anymor (ex: refridgerators)
- happy days, hollidays as happy picutres.  working weekdays as sad.  No, because you can be happy at work, and sad on hollidays due to the orgy of meterialism.  the hedonic treadmill.  companies convincing ppl what they've got isn;t good enough.  You are what you own.  Who you are is what you own.
- useless purchases that eventually get thrown away.
- religeron and community and happiness.  images of god & the devil
- what about settings so that people can choose both images, and that says something about their mood.  How many sad choices vs happy ones.
For this we need a settings file in each user created folder 
- disorganized things vs organized things.
- cold vs. warm
- ego vs. selflessness.
- homeless vs. warm homes
- wrapped gifts vs. ? opened gifts?  
- toys in their package vs. toys out of their packages.
- group of people vs. single people (non-exclusive)
- mental patients vs healthy minds (is is wrong to avoid mental health?)
- face mash.  what was the formula?
- the dali lama has a book on happiness
- affection humility, compassion.
- blank faces. non-exclusive
- professions.  non-exclusive.  can lead to an idication of what job would be good for someone.
