These are random notes as we get ready for the Programmer Level I Exam (associated with the "Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 7 Programmer"), as well as getting to know generics for the Level II Exam, along with learning Groovy and some Scala, and the beginnings of Java 8.

"an anonymous class seems a bit excessive and cumbersome."  (From 'Learning the Java Language' Trail)
So Java 8 contains closures as well.  The above is admiting that Java has been excessive and cumbersome for the past 20 years.  But maybe there is hope.  It would be nice if the docs admitted their inspiration.
They could say, "Thanks to efforts by the creators of Groovy, Scala and Clojur to simplify the Java language.  We have answered their calls after 10 years on JCP and introduced functions like lambda expressions (closures)."  They could even qualify this with "After all, they are riding on our coat-tails/bytcode platform".

Groovy: this.args.each{ arg -> println "hello, ${arg}"}
Java 8: p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE

Is programming finally being liberated from the von Neuman Style?
After reading some comments from the developers release page of Java 8, it seems at least one developer our of the 8 million isn't so happy about Lambda's:
"I uderstand the value of Lambdas but I'd prefer a slightly more verbose syntax if only it looked more 'Javaish' and easier to read... Perl as a culture favors tersness over readability.  This is evident in their syntax and total lack of comments in most public projects."
Well, like Democratic politics, that's what happens when you try to please everyone; no one likes it.

- RESTful - REpresentational State Transfer API.

- a sentence, as part of a conversation, has words in it which are learning objects that can either pass or fail upon different aspects, such as speaking (pronunciation) or listening, or writing (mispelling) or reading.  Listening and reading could be more problematic, because we dont know if the person missted the point of the sentence because of a certain unknown word, or a combination of words/grammer.  The same with listening.

- Clojure is designed around a few core engineering principles, such as Software Transactional Memory
-  imperative language


To do
- how does BoxDemo use the ArrayList when it is not returned after being operated on.  Is ArrayList a live class that will act like a memeber variable without being declared as such?  Indeed it does change without being a member variable.

Activity: An Activity is a type of Object making up the “this” in I did “this”; it is something with which an Actor interacted. It can be a unit of instruction
